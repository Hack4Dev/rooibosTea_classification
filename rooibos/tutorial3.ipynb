    "  * **[False positive](https://www.statisticshowto.com/false-positive-definition-and-examples/)**: This is where you receive a positive result for a test, when you should have received a negative (null) result. For example, it occurs when a cancer screening test comes back positive, but you don’t have the disease.\n",
    "  * **[False negative](https://www.statisticshowto.com/false-positive-definition-and-examples/)**: This is where a negative (null) test result is wrong. For example, in the Justice System, a false negative occurs when a guilty suspect is found “not guilty” and allowed to walk free.\n",

The $x$ and $y$ values depend on the threshold that is set (the thresholds themselves not shown in the graph--only the rates are shown).  For example, if we use the `TEAC-H2O` features and set the threshold  so that the false positive rate is 0.5 (i.e. the specificity is 1- 0.5 = 0.5), then the true positive rate (recall) is about 0.3. \n",

However, we can see that the TEAC_H2O and FRAP_H2O lines are *below* the dotted line.  This means that these classifiers are *worse* than random guessing.  How to solve this problem? Easy--instead of saying above the the threshold is 'positive', assign it to 'negative' (and similarly with below the threshold).

We do not know the actual accuracy of the classifiers: with more training and testing data, the accuracy estimate of any classifier will change.

In other words, if we do a more thorough test with more data, we expect to obtain an accuracy somewhere within the error bars. \n",

On the other hand, although it looks like `0.4,['TPC_H20','TEAC_H20']` is better than `0.4,['FRAP_H20']`, still we cannot conclude that the difference between the two classifiers is statistically significant, because of the large error bars on the accuracy estimate for  `0.4,['FRAP_H20']`."
